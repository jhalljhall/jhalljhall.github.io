  <h2 class="text-6 font-weight-600 text-center text-white mb-4">How to Become an Informed Buyer of Custom Software</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12">

      <p class="text-white">
        Have you ever gone into a software <b>Development</b> company, presented an idea, and asked, “how much will it cost” or “when will it be done”? If so, you are not alone.  
      </p>
  
      <p class="text-white-50">
      Were you surprised to hear the response or did you sense the vibes and blank stares from the Lead Developer or Technical Sales person as they contemplate your questions?  Did they say, “I don’t know” and get up to walk out?  Did they look disinterested? Did they make some knee jerk estimation that was outrageous? <span class="text-white">Did you walk away from your inquiry with confidence in knowing you have the right people on your <a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/first-who-then-what.html" target="_blank">bus and in the right seat</a>?</span> If this is a scenario that describes your past experience, then that is not uncommon and quite frankly, and it's sad. The question you should have asked them is, “are you able to identify my specific needs and problem solve in order to develop my custom software?” If you didn’t ask that and want to know how that relates to dollars and scents, then keep reading. Hopefully you will gain value in looking back on your experience with new insight.  Maybe you have thoughts that you wish to share after reading this article. Maybe the scenario I described ignites a fear to move forward with your new idea? If so, then this article will help you understand how you can become an informed buyer of custom software.
      </p>
        
      <p class="text-white-50">
      <span class="text-white">Know this first: not all custom software <b>Development</b> companies are created equal.</span>  Some companies may have devs on their team with a ton of experience or with little experience.  Some may have devs with competency in multiple tech stacks (layers of elements required to run a website, program, or mobile app, etc.) or only one tech stack.  Some companies may have exactly what you are looking for by providing a team like environment that is willing to collaborate and go on your journey alongside you. 
      </p>
        
      <p class="text-white-50">
        Some may look at you like a dog looks at a sound it doesn’t understand. 
      </p>
        
      <p class="text-white-50">
      Some companies may implement an Agile <b>Development</b> process for making custom software and some may not- tisk, tisk.  By the end of this article you will know five points that you should consider.
      </p>
        
      <p class="text-white">
      Some companies may not care about your project the way you do.
      </p>
        
      <p class="text-white-50 text-indent: 50px; text-it">
      To give all of the readers some context we will follow this User Story: <span class="text-white"><i>“As a buyer of custom software I want to understand more about the process so that I can have a great experience, deliver value for my target audience, and meet my goals.”</i></span>
      </p>
        
      <p class="text-white">
      What you should know first and foremost is: How the Soup is Made
      </p>
        
      <p class="text-white-50">
      Number one is <b> The Five D's</b> of software <b>Development</b>. They are <b>Discovery</b>, <b>Define</b>, <b>Design</b>, <b>Develop</b>, and <b>Deploy</b>. Understanding these pillars will help you be a better <b><a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-product-owner" target="_blank">Product Owner</a></b>.  Each pillar incurs costs.  Each pillar has goals, risks, and deliverables.  Each pillar in and of itself can be a place where great ideas die on the vine or new discoveries are revealed propelling a nascent project to great success!  It is hard to know what to expect of the dev team and your role as the <b>Product Owner</b> if you have never heard of <b>The Five D’s</b>. Ultimately, at the end of the day you are a <b>Product Owner</b>. So you should own the process and understand <b>The Five D’s</b>.
      </p>
        
      <p class="text-white-50">
      Below is a short description of each pillar or phase.
      </p>
        
      <ul>
        <li class="text-white">
        <b>Discovery</b> - work as a team to ideate, create goals, and draft an MVP
        </li>
        <li class="text-white">
        <b>Define</b> - identify and quantify the problems and plan the attack with a solid MVP
        </li>
        <li class="text-white">
        <b>Design</b> - visualize and architect the solution and process feedback
        </li>
        <li class="text-white"><b>Development</b> - implement the solution and achieve objectives
        </li>
        <li class="text-white"><b>Deployment</b> - deliver the developed solution
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-white-50">
      Lather, rinse, repeat, as you will certainly go through this lifecycle multiple times, or at least you should if you have the right type of dev team on board.  
      </p>
        
      <p class="text-white-50">
      Knowing this process can equip you with the understanding of the right questions to ask at the right time. You are now an enlightened buyer of custom software.
      </p>
        
      <h6 class="text-white">
      Within <b>The Five D’s</b> comes <b>The Churn</b>
      </h6>
        
      <p class="text-white-50">
      If your dev team of choice practices <b>The Five D’s</b>, then the next point you need to understand is the inevitable amount of churn, or changes, to expect when developing custom software. Here it is, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=churn&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS889US889&oq=churn&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i433i512l3j46i175i199i433i512j0i433i512j46i175i199i512j0i433i512j0i512l2.889j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">defined by Google</a>. Let’s combine a few of those phrases (assuming you clicked the link). Let’s mix, “to agitate or turn” with “encourage frequent turnover”. This is the way. Your role and the role of the development team should welcome changes and be willing to agitate each other to ensure best results.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680/ref=asc_df_0812979680/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312143020546&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8098015237515288803&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9014321&hvtargid=pla-435487045883&psc=1" target="_blank">Antifragile much</a>?  Heard of “Iron sharpens iron”, right?  A small grain of sand can create a beautiful pearl, right?

      <p class="text-white-50">
      If both you, the <b>Product Owner</b>, and the dev team, can adopt the process and standardize the way you engage, then you, your project, and your customers will benefit. Frequent collaboration and feedback loops sets the expectation that change is a constant. If you and your dev team are not communicating daily, validating ideas, entertaining questions and concerns, and willing to iterate in all phases, you may have a big risk to the project’s ability to succeed. Some <b>Product Owner</b>s, like yourself, are either extremely hands-off or extremely hands-on.  If you plan to be hands-off, then be ready to own the result.  It may not be in your favor. So understand that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/44RW9FEY76mLQCRQUjT0Zt?autoplay=true" target="_blank">change</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuM1FzIgRxs" target="_blank">change is gonna to come</a>.  Best embrace The Churn and be an <span class="text-white">enlightened and engaged buyer of custom software</span>.
      </p>
        
      <h6 class="text-white">
      From within The Churn comes the Rigor
      </h6>
        
      <p class="text-white-50">
      “People over process” is the one of the <b><a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank">12 Agile Principles</a></b>, but developing technical rigor through good daily and weekly habits within all of the phases are important. The saying goes, “you can’t manage what you fail to measure”. However, it doesn’t have to be so rigid that your project starts to stink of its dogma. <b><a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/smac-recipe.html" target="_blank">SMAC Lists</a></b> (specific, methodical, and consistent) are not evil, just check them at the door so as to not fall in a comfortable trap. If your dev team has these qualities and principles then you should be confident when a change is introduced that it will be handled appropriately, in the right way, by the right people.  Being on the same page might be cliche, however, if you are pragmatic and stick to a consistent and adopted practice that helps you and the dev team, then consider it protecting your investment.  You are now becoming an <span class="text-white">enlightened, engaged, and disciplined buyer of custom software</span>.
      </p>
        
      <h6 class="text-white">
      From the Rigor comes the Validation
      </h6>
        
      <p class="text-white-50">
      If you have never developed custom software then you can’t relate to what you are about to read. Spending money and time on testing is important. When you are finding bugs with custom software you enter into a realm of reputational risk. Ask yourself, “is there an amount of money I would give to improve my reputation or mitigate my reputational risk?”  How much would you spend?
      </p>
        
      <p class="text-white-50">
      Well, regardless of what that number is, if your dev team doesn’t believe in testing often and gathering feedback from your end users, then you will get what you pay for.  It might be expensive and drive up the costs, but once you have been bitten by a bug it is very difficult to put the broken eggs back in the carton. If you spent 40% or more of the entire scope of work in the <b>Discovery</b> and <b>Design</b> phases of your project, then consider testing validation for the time spent.   As the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth" target="_blank">Source of Truth</a></b>, you need to evaluate the value you are being provided by your dev team.  Did your team assist you in going down the correct path?  Did they prevent falling into pitfalls and avoiding landmines?  Are they able to validate the work and planning in the first hour of the project that inevitably saves valuable time prior to launch?  Now you are becoming an <span class="text-white">enlightened, engaged, disciplined, and validated buyer of custom software</span>.
      </p>
        
      <h6 class="text-white">
      From Validation to Measurement
      </h6>
        
      <p class="text-white-50">
      You can’t drive a car forward on the highway by looking in the rear view mirror. The same is true for software <b>Development</b> except you don’t have a mirror. I digress, however, knowing how much time a feature took to develop or how much money was spent over the course of a <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-in-scrum" target="_blank">Sprint</a> will help you answer your first questions, remember those? Heh. But instead of wishy-washy logic or a laissez faire attitude that can be easily cast aside by the dev team, you will stand on empirical information.  
      </p>
        
      <p class="text-white-50">
      Even better are the questions you’ve yet to consider like “How much did you learn?”  What informed decisions did you make that helped shape your project and assist your team during <b>Development</b>?  What assumptions did you have that were challenged or wrong?  Which assumptions were validated? When did you feel uninformed and unsupported?  When did your dev team feel uninformed and unsupported? How did you overcome challenges during the process?  How often did you communicate the challenges?  How much time did you spend in each phase as a result looking over the details?  What did you look over to prevent missing critical information?  Does the latest iteration of the software work based on your current understanding and expectations?  Was the journey worth the effort?  
      </p>
        
      <p class="text-white-50">
      Shoo, that was a lot of questions!  Still, you are now an <span class="text-white">enlightened, engaged, disciplined, validated, and empirical buyer of custom software</span>.
      </p>
        
      <p class="text-white-50">
      By now you hopefully have some idea that being involved and becoming a part of the process is important when buying custom software.  It helps define what it is you and your dev team are building, not just the “guestiment” or some imaginary timeline. You may find out that you like the process.  You might feel empowered and discover a piece of the puzzle that was missing all along.  Instead of asking, “how much” and “when will it be ready”, you might ask “what is it and how can I be a part of the solution?”  If you proposed those questions to the devs at the software company down the street, they might fall over in their chair or ask to buy your lunch.
      </p>
        
      <p class="text-white-50">
      Last questions.  Do you feel informed by this article?  Would you consider yourself an <span class="text-white">informed buyer of custom software</span> now that you have read it?
