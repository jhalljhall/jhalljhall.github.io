        <p class="text-white-50">Baseball For Everyone is a Deck Building card game.  Make your own player, collect other players, build a team, and play the game of baseball. BFE is a deck building game that replicates the feel of baseball.  Players try to out smart each other by manipulating 'the count'.</p>
        <p class="text-white-50">Experience the strategy of baseball on a level that other games have yet to deliver.  Players will compete in a head-to-head matchup. Choose a strategy with a custom deck comprising of a manager, players, and action cards.  The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins!</p>
